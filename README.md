### DEFINITELY NOT PRODUCTION READY

Voldermort client written in Go

The client allows you to either use nice ready made methods (get/put etc) or expose the Voldemort protobufs objects to create your own requests.

There are advantages to both but you need to understand why you are choosing one over the other so I suggest you give the Voldemort wiki a good read first - the link is at the bottom.
